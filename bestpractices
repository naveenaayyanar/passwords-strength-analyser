✅ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Use at least 12–16 characters

   * The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.

2. Include a mix of character types

   * Uppercase letters (A–Z)
   * Lowercase letters (a–z)
   * Numbers (0–9)
   * Special characters (`!@#$%^&*()` etc.)

3. Avoid dictionary words or common phrases

   * Don’t use words like `password`, `admin`, or `qwerty`.

4. Avoid personal information

   * No birthdays, names, phone numbers, or pet names.

5. Don’t reuse passwords across websites

   * Each account should have a unique password.

6. Use passphrases when possible

   * Combine unrelated words with symbols:
     Example: `Red$Monkey!Drives9Bikes`

7. Use a password manager

   * Let it generate and store strong, unique passwords for every account.

8. Change passwords if there’s a breach

   * Check sites like [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your info has been leaked.

9. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

   * Use a second verification step (e.g., code sent to phone or an app like Google Authenticator).

10. Test your password

    * Use trusted tools like [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/) or [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/) to check strength.

❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Using simple passwords like `123456`, `admin`, or `letmein`.
* Keyboard patterns like `qwerty` or `asdfgh`.
* Reusing the same password across multiple sites.
* Writing down passwords in unsecured places.
