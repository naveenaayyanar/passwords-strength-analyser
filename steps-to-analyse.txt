### 📘 3. Best Practices Learned

* Use **at least 12 characters**.
* Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
* Avoid **dictionary words or personal info** (e.g., birthdates).
* **Don’t reuse** passwords across multiple sites.
* Use **passphrases** (e.g., “My\$DogEats!PizzaEvery4PM”) for better memorability and strength.

### 🧠 4. Common Password Attacks (Explained)

| Attack Type             | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brute Force**         | Tries every possible combination of characters.       |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Uses a list of common passwords and words.            |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks you into entering your password on fake sites. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked passwords from other sites.               |

### 📊 5. Password Complexity & Security

* **More characters = exponentially more combinations**.
* A 6-character password can be cracked in seconds.
* A 12-character random password can take **centuries** to break.
* Complexity makes **dictionary attacks ineffective**.

### 🛡️ 6. Additional Concepts

#### ✅ What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

It’s an extra layer of security (like a code sent to your phone or an app verification) in addition to a password.

#### ✅ How Do Password Managers Help?

They generate and store strong passwords so you don’t have to remember them. This avoids reuse and improves security.

#### ✅ What Are Passphrases?

They are long phrases (with or without symbols) that are easier to remember and harder to crack. Example: `Sunshine@OnMy$Window23!`

#### ❌ Common Password Mistakes

* Using `123456`, `password`, or names.
* Using personal data like birthdays.
* Reusing passwords across platforms.
